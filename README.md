# web-mapping-lab4

Compares different web map services with a Corvallis basemap. Basemap designed in [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/index.html), spatial data hosted using [Geoserver](http://geoserver.org/) on a (really slow) machine through the Google Cloud platform. Uses [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) with [Leaflet-VectorGrid](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.VectorGrid) and [Leaflet-Sync](https://github.com/turban/Leaflet.Sync).

Pressing F12 (on Chrome) and following along with the network requests is highly recommended to best compare the size differences for each map service.

Fair warning: The Geoserver machine is really, really slow (1.5 GHz single-core, 1.7gb RAM)
